## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

After discussing with the group possible alternatives for a topic, such as video game sales, and air traffic data. We decided to settle on mushroom classification. We thought this would be an interesting topic as fungi can be extremely diverse, and we all found it very interesting how they got organized into different categories depending on specific features. Moreover, since mushrooms are such a common ingredient in cuisines around the world, we became curious about the characteristics that might make a mushroom edible or not (if any). The data set we found allows us to take a deeper look at this question, to see if we can tell if a mushroom is poisonous just by looking at them. We want to see if it is possible to find a correlation between the physical features of the mushroom and its Edibility to help the mushroom hunters around the world.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Synthetic sample data based on 23 species of gilled mushroom pulled from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). This data was generated for use as a training set for machine learning projects by UCI Machine Learning.

The data describes if the mushrooms are definitely edible or if they are poisonous or if it's unknown, in which case they are grouped with the poisonous category ("When in doubt throw them out"). Furthermore, the data goes over the observable physical features of the hypothetical mushrooms, such as gill size and spacing, odor, cap color, and much more. The data provides 8124 samples, recording 23 different parameters.

The data was originally donated to UCI ML on April 27 1987.
